Installation
============

To begin using Recolon, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Recolon Repository**
   - Start by cloning the Recolon repository from the official source:
   
   .. code-block:: bash

      git clone https://github.com/Breijen/recolon

   - Navigate to the root of the cloned repository:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cd recolon

2. **Build the Recolon Compiler**
   - Recolon is built using Rust, so ensure you have Rust installed on your machine. If not, you can install it by following the instructions on the `official Rust website <https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install>`_.
   - To build the Recolon compiler, run the following command in the root of the Recolon repository:

   .. code-block:: bash

      cargo build --release

   - This command compiles the Recolon compiler, producing an executable that you can use to run your `.rcn` files.

3. **Run Your First Recolon Program**
   - After building the compiler, youâ€™re ready to run your first Recolon program. 

   - Create a new file with the `.rcn` extension.

   - Open the file in your preferred text editor and add the following code:

   .. code-block:: python

      var greeting = "Hello, Recolon!";
      log(greeting);

   - Save the file and execute it using the Recolon interpreter:

   .. code-block:: bash

      ./target/release/recolon hello_world.rcn

   - You should see the following output in your terminal:

   .. code-block:: text

      LOG "Hello, Recolon!"

Now you're all set to explore Recolon and start developing your own programs!
